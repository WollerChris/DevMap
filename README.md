# DevMap

## Problem Statement:
We are unable to quickly see how many Galvanize graduates we have in our work force and need an easy way to assess their current unit/locations using a density map. Additionally, we need to view how long they have been at their current locations to enable personnel movements.

Fix: Develop application that will retrieve personnel data for quick view enabling us to assess talent management/work force needs
